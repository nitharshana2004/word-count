    <h1>Find the Most Common Words</h1>
    <textarea id="inputText" rows="10" cols="50">
        In this assignment, you'll need to start with a given string that contains a number of words. Then, define the number of times each word appears in the given text. After that point, you will see what the top three words used are.
        The starter code already has some of this functionality implemented. Please go through the code in the wordcount.js file and read the comments to understand how this logic will work.

        function findMostCommonWords() {

            let wordsArray = text.replace(/[^\w\s]/g, "").split(/\s+/);

            wordsArray.forEach(word => {
                wordCount[word] = (wordCount[word] || 0) + 1;
            });
             let sortedWords = Object.entries(wordCount).sort((a, b) => b[1] - a[1]);
             let topThreeWords = sortedWords.slice(0, 3);
            console.log("Top 3 Most Common Words:");
            topThreeWords.forEach(([word, count], index) => {
                console.log(`${index + 1}. ${word}: ${count} times`);
